description = "ADR - Architectural Decision Record"

prompt = """

## Purpose

Research, evaluate, and document architectural decisions with explicit human approval. Prevents decision delegation by forcing structured consideration of alternatives before committing to an approach.

## CRITICAL: THIS IS A MULTI-TURN CONVERSATION

**You MUST stop and wait for user input at each phase boundary.**

This workflow has THREE mandatory checkpoints. You CANNOT skip them. You CANNOT combine phases. You CANNOT make the decision yourself.

If you find yourself writing a complete ADR with a decision without having asked the user which option to choose, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** -- you have violated the workflow.

---

## When to Use

- New abstraction or pattern being introduced
- Multiple viable implementation approaches with significant tradeoffs
- Technology or dependency choice
- Interface design that will be hard to change later
- Deviation from established codebase patterns
- Agent flags "this requires a decision" during implementation
- Reviewer spots undocumented architectural choice in PR

## When NOT to Use

- Obvious choices with no real alternatives
- Following established codebase patterns exactly
- Decisions already documented elsewhere (RFC, design doc)
- Trivial implementation details

## Command

```
/wf-adr <decision-title>
```

Optional context flag when triggered from an issue:
```
/wf-adr <decision-title> --issue <issue-identifier>
```

---

## Phase 0: Qualification Check

Before researching, evaluate whether this decision warrants an ADR.

### Steps

1. **Check "When to Use" criteria**
   - Does this match at least one of:
     - New abstraction or pattern being introduced
     - Multiple viable implementation approaches with significant tradeoffs
     - Technology or dependency choice
     - Interface design that will be hard to change later
     - Deviation from established codebase patterns
     - Agent flags "this requires a decision" during implementation
     - Reviewer spots undocumented architectural choice in PR

2. **Check "When NOT to Use" exclusions**
   - Is this any of these? (If yes, do NOT proceed with ADR)
     - Obvious choice with no real alternatives
     - Following established codebase patterns exactly
     - Decision already documented elsewhere (RFC, design doc)
     - Trivial implementation detail

3. **Check for existing documentation**
   - Is this decision already captured in an existing ADR, design doc, or RFC?

### Phase 0 Output

Present qualification verdict:

> **ADR Qualification Assessment**
>
> **Decision:** [decision title]
>
> **Matches "When to Use" criteria:**
> - [x] [Criterion that applies] - [brief explanation]
> - [ ] [Criterion that doesn't apply]
>
> **Matches "When NOT to Use" exclusions:**
> - [ ] Obvious choice - [No/Yes: explanation]
> - [ ] Follows existing pattern - [No/Yes: explanation]
> - [ ] Already documented - [No/Yes: explanation]
> - [ ] Trivial detail - [No/Yes: explanation]
>
> **Verdict:** [QUALIFIES / DOES NOT QUALIFY]
>
> **Reasoning:** [1-2 sentences]

---

## MANDATORY STOP 0

**DO NOT proceed to Phase 1 until the user confirms this warrants an ADR.**

If verdict is DOES NOT QUALIFY, suggest alternatives:
- "This appears to follow existing patterns. Consider just documenting in code comments."
- "This seems trivial. Proceed without ADR?"
- "This is already covered in [existing doc]. Reference that instead?"

**Violations:**
- Starting research without qualification check
- Proceeding when verdict is DOES NOT QUALIFY without user override

---

## What the Agent Does

### Phase 1: Research (ONLY after user confirms qualification)

1. **Understand the decision context**
   - What problem requires a decision?
   - What constraints exist (technical, organizational, timeline)?
   - What does the codebase currently do in similar situations?

2. **Identify decision drivers**
   - What factors matter for this decision?
   - What is the relative weight of each factor?
   - Which constraints are hard vs soft?

3. **Identify options**
   - Research viable approaches (minimum 2, typically 3-4)
   - Include "do nothing" or "minimal change" if applicable
   - Consider both internal patterns and industry approaches

4. **Analyze tradeoffs**
   - Pros and cons for each option
   - How each option addresses the decision drivers
   - Expected consequences (positive, negative, risks)

---

## MANDATORY STOP 1: After Research

**STOP HERE. Do not proceed until user responds.**

After completing research (Phase 1), ask the user:

> "I've identified this as an architectural decision about [topic].
>
> Decision drivers I found:
> - [Driver 1] (weight: High/Medium/Low)
> - [Driver 2] (weight: High/Medium/Low)
> - [Driver 3] (weight: High/Medium/Low)
>
> Are these the right factors? Should I:
> - **Proceed** - drivers look correct, continue to options analysis
> - **Adjust weights** - [tell me which to change]
> - **Add drivers** - [tell me what's missing]
> - **Remove drivers** - [tell me which aren't relevant]"

**Wait for user response before proceeding to Phase 2.**

---

### Phase 2: Present (ONLY after user confirms drivers)

Present findings using the project ADR template format.

---

## ADR Content Requirements

The ADR document contains EXACTLY these sections, in this order:

### 1. Status
Format: `**Proposed**` (will become `**Accepted**` after decision)

### 2. Context
- What situation requires this decision?
- What constraints exist?
- What is the current state?
- Keep under 30 lines

### 3. Decision Drivers
Table format with Weight column:
| Driver | Weight |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Factor] | High/Medium/Low |

### 4. Options Considered
For each option (minimum 2, typically 3-4):
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- **Pros:** 3-5 bullet points
- **Cons:** 3-5 bullet points

### 5. Agent Recommendation
- **Recommended:** Option [X]
- **Reasoning:** Why this option best addresses the decision drivers (3-5 sentences)
- **Caveats:** What could make this the wrong choice (2-3 bullets)

### 6. Decision
`**Use [Selected Option]** for [purpose/use case].`
_[Human fills in after selecting]_

### 7. Rationale
Numbered reasons why this option was chosen
_[Human fills in after selecting]_

### 8. Consequences
Agent fills in based on analysis:
- **Positive:** Expected benefits (3-5 bullets)
- **Negative:** Expected downsides (2-4 bullets)
- **Risks:** Known risks with mitigations (2-4 bullets)

### 9. References
Links to relevant documentation, articles, or resources

---

## STRICT: No Extra Content

The ADR contains ONLY the 9 sections listed above.

If you want to add something that doesn't fit in these sections, STOP and ask:
"I have additional information about [topic]. Should I create a separate design document?"

**Length target:** Total ADR under 150 lines.

### Phase 3: Record

### Pre-Record Checklist

Before writing the final ADR:

1. **Length check:** Will the ADR be under 150 lines?
   - If not, identify what to summarize or move to design doc

2. **Content check:** Does it contain ONLY template sections?
   - If not, remove or relocate extra content

3. **Template compliance:** All required sections present?

After human selects option and completes Decision/Rationale sections:

1. Agent fills in Consequences section based on option analysis
2. Update status to **Accepted**
3. Save to `docs/architecture/wf-adrs/NNN-<decision-title>.md`
4. If linked to issue, reference in issue file
5. If during implementation, add reference to task's Implementation Notes
6. Remind human to update ADR README table

## Output Location

```
docs/architecture/wf-adrs/
  001-canvas-library.md
  002-state-management.md
  003-api-versioning.md
```

## ADR Numbering

Sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.) maintained by checking existing files in `docs/architecture/wf-adrs/`.

## What Makes a Good ADR

1. **Focused** - One decision per ADR
2. **Options are real** - Not strawmen to justify predetermined choice
3. **Tradeoffs are honest** - Every option has cons
4. **Drivers weighted** - Clear what matters most
5. **Context preserved** - Future readers understand why this mattered
6. **Consequences documented** - Both positive and negative outcomes

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Single option presented | No real decision, just documentation | Require minimum 2 viable options |
| Strawman alternatives | Decision already made, ADR is theater | Options must be genuinely viable |
| Novel-length ADR | Won't be read or maintained | Keep under 150 lines |
| ADR after implementation | Decision already locked in | ADR before code, or accept tech debt |
| Skipping rationale | No audit trail for why | Require human to state reasoning |
| ADR for trivial choices | Process overhead without value | Reserve for significant decisions |
| All drivers "High" weight | No real prioritization | Force ranking of what matters most |
| Extra sections added | Scope creep, implementation details | Stick to the 9 template sections only |

## Lifecycle

```
Proposed  ->  Accepted   ->  [Superseded by ADR-XXX]
          ->  Rejected       [Deprecated]
```

When a later decision changes an earlier one:
1. Update the original ADR status to **Superseded by ADR-XXX**
2. Link to the PR that made the change
3. Reference the original ADR in the new ADR's Context section

## Checklist Before Merge

When an ADR is accepted:

- [ ] Status updated to **Accepted** with PR link
- [ ] ADR README table updated with new entry
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated if ADR introduces new standards/constraints
- [ ] Related issue/task references added
